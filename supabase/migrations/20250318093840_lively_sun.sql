  # Add Team Matches Support

  1. New Tables
    - `teams`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `name` (text)
      - `emoji` (text)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `team_players`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `team_id` (uuid, foreign key)
      - `player_id` (uuid, foreign key)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
    
    - `team_matches`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `team1_id` (uuid, foreign key)
      - `team2_id` (uuid, foreign key)
      - `team1_score` (integer)
      - `team2_score` (integer)
      - `played_at` (timestamp)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)

  2. Views
    - Add team statistics view
    
  3. Security
    - Enable RLS on new tables
    - Add policies for all operations
